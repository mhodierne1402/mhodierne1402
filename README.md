# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark Hodierne




- Iâ€™m interested in AI/Machine Learning and how this can help my mission ... "Spending the next 40 years taking actions that tackle our planetary crisis".
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement Deep Learning models. Iâ€™m in the early stages of ML exploration, and I'll happily collaborate with others and help out wherever I can.

### **CURRENT PROJECT: Computer Vision - Object Recognition on Football Pitches**
- Detecting the players, their team (and the ball!) on a football pitch, together with the direction they're facing.
- Convolutional Neural Network: YOLO architecture with a custom loss function.

### **CURRENT PROJECT: Document Ranking - MS MARCO Dataset**
- Deep learning model that takes a search query and returns the 10 most relevant documents using the Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension dataset.
- 'Two Tower' Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with triplet loss function to train with positive and negative training samples.
- RNNs coded from first principles in PyTorch. Compared vanilla RNNs with GRUs and LSTMs.
- Implemented with MLFlow for tracking experiments. Deployed with FastAPI and Docker.
