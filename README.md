- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark Hodierne - @mhodierne1402
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/Machine Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement Deep Learning models
- 💞️ I’m just starting my exploration of ML, and I'll happily collaborate with others and help out wherever I can
- 📫 My contact details are:

CURRENT PROJECTS:
Image Caption Generator:
- An exploration of deep learning models using computer vision and natural language processing techniques.
  Trained on datasets of images paired with human-written captions - using the Flickr8K and MSCOCO datasets.
  Three main architectures will be explored:
  A convolutional neural network plus recurrent neural network architecture
  An attention-based mechanism which improves relevancy through visual guidance, and
  Transformer models designed for parallelized computation and enhanced contextual modeling through self-attention.

- The Polytope Permutation Puzzle - a Kaggle competition:
-     An exploration of traditional heuristic search methods.
-     Probably well beyond my capabilities to solve this puzzle, but I'm using it as an opportunity to re-learn and apply Dijkstra's algorithm.
-     I will compare performance with other algorithms such as A* and IDA* search. I will learn about heuristic search and methods of optimization.
