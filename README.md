# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark Hodierne




- Iâ€™m interested in AI/Machine Learning.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement Deep Learning models. Iâ€™m just starting my exploration of ML, and I'll happily collaborate with others and help out wherever I can.

### **CURRENT PROJECT: Image Caption Generator**
- An exploration of deep learning models using computer vision and natural language processing techniques.
- Trained on datasets of images paired with human-written captions - using the Flickr8K and MSCOCO datasets.
- Three main architectures will be explored:
A convolutional neural network plus recurrent neural network architecture
An attention-based mechanism which improves relevancy through visual guidance, and
Transformer models designed for parallelized computation and enhanced contextual modeling through self-attention.

### **CURRENT PROJECT: The Polytope Permutation Puzzle - a Kaggle competition**
- An exploration of traditional heuristic search methods.
- Probably well beyond my capabilities to solve this puzzle, but I'm using it as an opportunity to re-learn and apply Dijkstra's algorithm.
- I will compare performance with other algorithms such as A* and IDA* search. I will learn about heuristic search and methods of optimization.
